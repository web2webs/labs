# Welcome to StackEdit!

This repository is intended to share my implementations of different algorithms, especially in the field of machine learning. I will try to document the code and comment it. I will also try to comment the algorithms, their time complexity, their parameters and their prons and cons...


# Implementations

- Sarsa($\lambda$) using Numpy,  [here](https://github.com/web2webs/labs/blob/main/Tabular_SARSA_lambda.ipynb) ( implementation from [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) )
- Sarsa($\lambda$) using PyTorch, fast using GPU,  [here](https://github.com/web2webs/labs/blob/main/Tabular%20SARSA%20lambda%20pytorch.ipynb)
